Any contributions to FUBS are welcome. Here are some things that you can do.

- Raise an issue for any bugs, typos, grammar, or other problems you find in the game.
- Fix issues in the source and send a pull request.
- Add something entirely new to FUBS.

Modding the source for FUBS can be easy for small things, but unforgiving when there are syntax errors. Please review <a href="https://github.com/prayForPlague/FUBS/blob/master/Fate Syntax.md">Fate Syntax.md</a> to get started with the format that FUBS is written in.

###ONE MAJOR RULE

The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By "distribute anything we've made" what we mean is:

- give copies of our Game to anyone else;
- make commercial use of anything we've made;
- try to make money from anything we've made; or
- let other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;

unless we specifically agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear, "the Game" or "what we have made" includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for our Game on all platforms. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified versions of a Game, part of those things, or anything else we've made.

Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don't do those things that we say you can't.
